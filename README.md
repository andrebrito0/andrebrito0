# 👋 Hello there!

My name is **André Brito** and I'm an **applied mathematician** and **epidmiologist in training** living in Lisbon, originally from the sunny south of Portugal. With a passion for statistics, optimization, and programming, I thrive on solving real-world problems through data and mathematics. Currently, I'm PhD Student in Mathematics at the Science and Technology School of Nova University Lisbon - NOVA FCT, with specialization in Statistics and Risk Management. I'll focus my research on epidemiology and statistical and mathematical modeling.

## 🎓 Academic Journey
- **BSc in Mathematics Applied to Economics and Management**  
  Loved courses like Statistics, Data Analysis, and Graph Algorithms, where I got to code optimization algorithms from scratch.  
- **MSc in Mathematics and Applications (Specialization in Actuarial Sciences, Statistics & Operations Research)**  
  Developed a knack for statistical modeling and numerical methods.
- **PhD Student in Mathematics**
  Currently a part of the PhD in Mathematics at NOVA FCT, really focused in epidemiology.

## 🧪 Career Highlights
- **Resarch Scientist at National Health Institute**  
  🎓 PhD researcher at INSA’s Department of Epidemiology.  
  📊 Work with large epidemiological datasets for public health research and surveillance.  
  💉 Contribute to the VEBIS vaccine-effectiveness study (ECDC) — EHR data management, statistical analysis, reporting.  
  🛠️ Design data structures, implement processing pipelines, and build analysis scripts for epidemiological studies.  

- **Data Expert Consultant**  
  💡 Helped other people get their data organized through scripting.  
  🎯 Developed Dashboards in Power BI for result monitoring and reporting.  
- **Data Analyst/Manager at BNITM**  
  🦠 Cleaned and managed databases for a study on neglected tropical diseases in Madagascar.  
  📊 Automated reports and performed statistical analyses.  
- **Underwriting Analyst at AIG**  
  📈 Developed dashboards, scripted automations, and led actuarial reviews.  
- **Research Projects**  
  🌡 Designed an early-warning system for extreme temperatures in Portugal (Award-winning research 🎉).

## 🌟 What Drives Me?
- Solving complex problems with elegant mathematical and programming solutions.  
- Working in international, collaborative environments.  
- Helping teams bring their data to life through analysis and visualization.

## 🌍 Outside of Work
I’m a big fan of urban living, traveling, and hiking (Dolomites are my favorite so far!). I’m also an avid reader, gym enthusiast, and history buff.
